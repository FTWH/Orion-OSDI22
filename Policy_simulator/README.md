# Policy Simulator:
 In this folder, we give the code for the policy simulator.

 1. The different policies are in the Policy folder and can be extended to new policies
 2. It can generate timing plots based on the function run. The default is either a delay vs skew plot where both values of delay and skew can be changed or a policy from the policy folder. 
 3. It can also print the E2E latency and utilization percentage.
 4. main.py can be edited to customize for any other policy. 

Usage
```
 python3 main.py
```
