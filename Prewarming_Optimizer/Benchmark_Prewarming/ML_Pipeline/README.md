This folder contains the benchmarking scripts to compare prewarming to No prewarming

## Usage:

```
For prewarming:
./E2E_collect_with_prewarming.sh <Number_of_runs>

For no prewarming:
./E2E_collect_No_prewarming.sh <Number_of_runs>

recommended:
Number_of_runs=10
```

## Expected Outputs:
Latency with prewarming:
E2E Latency:19.346652030944824 seconds
E2E Latency:16.121007442474365 seconds

Latency with No prewarming:
E2E Latency: 24.94816780090332 seconds
E2E Latency: 24.94816780090332 seconds
